                        Charlie
                        Palmer. Ferraro’s first project with The Collective partners him with the Durst Organization at

                        Chef Ferraro has infused flavors from his global travels – to France, Italy, Spain, Russia,

                        and diners alike. His travels have also blended with media on occasion, when his trip to Taiwan
                        was filmed and documented into a show for the Discovery Channel (U.S.) and Discovery World
                        (Canada).
                        Outside of the restaurant, Ferraro works with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, Savor Health

                        resources, tips and recipes for the caregivers and patients dealing with the disease. A cause
                        close to his heart, Cooking. Comfort. Care. allows him to channel his culinary expertise for the
                        aid of those in need.</p>
